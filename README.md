# TODO QUICK:

# TODO
- add option to not require logging in, choose default account
- add well basically the whole client
- add well almost the whole server (handling '/set' requests)
- add data file backups
- add data file validation when using /set
- should i add routes for each 'set' action client does?
- should i add a log on the client side to display the status of changes?
- write documentation
    - json schema
    - decrypting datafile locally
    - actions

# IMPORTANT (for me):
## PERMISSIONS:
1. read (1)
2. write (2)

# why?
because i saw it. it was bautiful. and then i got angry because it wasn't open source and i want it to run locally
if i'm wrong, please tell me somehow, maybe through issues on github
also it's very likely that i will copy the design, because it would be very hard to come up with a better one, maybe even impossible

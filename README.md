# a habit keeper app [inspired](#why) by [Everyday](https://everyday.app) habit app

first time using deno

i wish you a good life and succesful new habits or something

# TODO
- BOARDS SHOULD BE IMAGINARY AND UP TO REPRESENTATION INSTEAD OF THE THE THE THE THE THE THE STRUCTORE I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, BUT IT SHOULD BE JUST HABITS AND MAYBE LISTS BUT NOT BOARDS NO NO NO NO NO NO
- FOCUS ON MAKING IT USABLE and then improve
- stop with the ROUNDED CORNERS
- replace all console.warn with just assert()
- add clean up for expired tokens
- add admin control panel
- add the option to register a new user on the client
- add well basically the whole client
- add well almost the whole server (handling '.../action' requests)
- add data file backups
- write documentation
    - json schema
    - decrypting datafile locally
    - actions
- should i add a log (history) on the client side to display the status of changes?
- should i create some sort of teams/groups?
- IS THERE GOING TO BE A RACE CONDITION???????????????????? (if yes, maybe with each getData thing also response with datafile hash or something and when an action is performed check if hashes are equal, if yes then proceed, else disregard action and refresh data)

# IMPORTANT (for me):
## PERMISSIONS:
1. read (1)
2. write (2)

## ADMIN PERMISSIONS:
1. read (1)

# why
because i saw it. it was bautiful. and then i got angry because it wasn't open source and i want it to run locally
if i'm wrong, please tell me somehow, maybe through issues on github
also it's very likely that i will copy the design, because it would be very hard to come up with a better one, maybe even impossible

# TODO QUICK:

# TODO
- add option to not require logging in, choose default account
- add well basically the whole client
- add well almost the whole server (handling '/set' requests)
- add data file backups
- add data file validation when using /set
- should i add routes for each 'set' action client does?
- should i add a log on the client side to display the status of changes?

# IMPORTANT (for me):
## PERMISSIONS:
1. read (1)
2. write (2)
